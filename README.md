# Drivechain Launcher

ðŸš§ Under construction

This application is built using [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

Godot may seem like an odd choice at first glance, but with its cross-platform abilities and an amazing set of GUI &
IO features, it makes it very capabile for this application. 

We are currently focusing on Linux, but are also working on support for Mac and Windows

If you'd like to build from source check below.

## Development Enviornment Prerequisites

- Godot 4.1.1 [Download Page](https://godotengine.org/download)

Currently only scripted in GDScript, but we could use the .NET version of Godot which brings C# support

Once you've gotten your development environment setup

- Clone repo
- Open the project and run
